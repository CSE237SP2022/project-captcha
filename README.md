# project-captcha
What user stories were completed this iteration?
- We created a captcha text that pops up in another window. The user then is supposed to retype the displayed text into the console to match. If the text doesn't match,
  the user is prompted again until the input is correct.
<p>What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?</p>
-We intend to distort the text in the captcha to make it more difficult to transcribe. Also we intend to randomize the text outputs to the user.
<p>Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?</p>
- No
<p> What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!) </p>
<p>command 1 : javac -cp lib/stdlib-package.jar -d bin</p>
<p>command 2: java -cp "bin:lib/stdlib-package.jar" captcha.Main_Class</p>
